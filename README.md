# ATtiny84 Clock

This is a small project aimed at creating a clock using the ATtiny84 microcontroller.

## TODO
-----------------------------------

### 1 MHz Internal Oscillator Version
* [ ] Create a fritzing design to upload.
* [ ] Write assembly instructions.
* [ ] Upload to Arduino Project Hub.

## 16 MHz External Oscillator Version
* [ ] Create functions to use a shift register to turn on/off displays.
* [ ] Handle AM/PM LED.
* [ ] Handle Colon LED.
* [ ] Create a Fritzing design to upload.
* [ ] Write assembly instructions.
* [ ] Upload to Arduino Project Hub.


## Notes
* The 1 MHz Internal Oscillator Version of the project does not keep time accurately. This is due to the fact that the Internal Oscillator in the ATtiny84 changes frequeny slightly due to changes in voltage or tempurature. Because of this, not as much work will be put into this version of the clock design.
